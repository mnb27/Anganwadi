## Vision for the app 
This app will take a decentralised approach, data will be taken by ANM
workers where the above given information will be taken, the app will then identify pregnancies
that are high risk. To enable an accountability structure, every pregnancy will be mapped with an
asha and an anm worker. Ideally the life-cycle of each patient from conception of pregnancy to
delivery can be tracked; the steps that are to be taken for an ideal pregnancy can be ticked and
edited as time passes.
